"""
Approach: 
=> First, run a loop for N times(0 to N-1). This loop will ensure to print each row of the pattern.

=> Inside the outer loop, run another loop for current value of the outer loop variable. It will basically ensure that the total columns is equal to the current row.

=> Within the inner loop, print an asterisk (*) without moving to a new line. This keeps all asterisks for a single row on the same line.

=> After the inner loop completes, move to a new line to start printing the next row.

Complexity Analysis: 
=> Time Complexity : O(N2). As the outer loop runs for N time and the inner loop runs incrementally in each iteration(1+2+3+...+N), which is equal to (N*(N+1)/2). So, overall it is O(N2).

=> Space Complexity :O(1). As no extra space is being used to print the patterns.
