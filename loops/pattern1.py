"""
Approach: 
=> Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to (N-1), where N is the number of rows. This loop will ensure to print each row of the pattern.

=> Inner loops makes sure that N stars are printed in every line, eventually since the inner loop will run for N times, it will make sure that N stars are printed in N lines, resulting in a square of size N x N, which is the desired pattern

=> Now, print the asterisks for each column of a row, inside the inner loop.

=> Move to a new line after printing each row to maintain the right-angled triangle shape of the pattern.

Complexity Analysis: 
=> Time Complexity:O(N2) As two for loops are being used to print the patterns and both of them runs for N time.

=> Space Complexity: As no additional space is used, so the Space Complexity is O(1)
