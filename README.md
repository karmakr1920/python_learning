## 📚 What You'll Find Here

### ✅ Python Fundamentals
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Control Flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and Recursion
- Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets
- File Handling
- Modules and Packages
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 🧠 Problem Solving
- Daily solved problems from topics like:

## 📅 Study Plan & Structure
# 🐍 Python + DSA Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is a curated collection of my notes, code snippets, and problem-solving practice as I build a strong foundation in Python and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). The focus is hands-on: learning by doing, solving, and applying.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each topic is organized into its own folder, containing:
- 📓 Notes & explanations
- 🧠 Solved problems
- 🛠️ Small tools or concept-based mini projects

---

## 🧵 Python Concepts

- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- Modules & Packages
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

## 🔧 Topic-Based Mini Tools / Projects

> These are not full apps, but practical tools or simulations to reinforce learning of each topic.

Examples:
- String Formatter / Vowel Counter
- List-based TODO CLI
- Set Membership Checker
- Dictionary-based Quiz App
- Stack Visualizer
- Recursion Tree Generator (console-based)

## 🎯 Goal

To gain solid understanding over:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Common coding patterns
- DSA for technical interviews

---

## ⏳ Progress Tracker

- 📅 Daily commits with topics covered
- 🔖 Weekly problem sets from Leetcode
- 📘 Regular revision and refactoring of code

---

> “You don’t really understand something unless you can build with it.”


- Each topic has its own folder or file with:
  - 📓 Notes and explanations
  - 🧪 Sample code & practice problems
  - ✅ Solved examples
